RFGhost is a Python application designed to monitor and detect anomalies in RF signals. It uses statistical methods to analyze signal patterns and alerts users when unusual activity is detected.

## Features

- **RF Signal Monitoring**: Continuously scans and processes RF signals.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses statistical analysis to identify unusual signal patterns.
- **Alert System**: Sends notifications via email and webhooks when anomalies are detected.
- **Configurable**: Easily customizable through a YAML configuration file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RFGhost.git
   cd RFGhost
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   python main.py -c custom_config.yaml
   ```

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file allows you to customize:
- RF interface settings (sample rate, frequency, gain)
- Anomaly detection threshold
- Alert settings (email, webhook)
